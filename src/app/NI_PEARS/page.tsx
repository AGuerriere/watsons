            <p>Instead of waiting for a GP appointment or attending A&E, patients presenting with an acute, sudden onset, non-sight threatening eye problem can now make an appointment with us as a local PEARS qualified optician and be seen within one or two working days to provide treatment for the issue as soon as possible and reduce any anxiety it may be causing you.</p><br />
            <p>We will assess and treat the condition or make a referral where appropriate.</p><br />
